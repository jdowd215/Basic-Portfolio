    <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I was born on February 15, 1980 and grew up in Issaquah, Washington.  After completing high school, I attended California Lutheran University and graduated with a B.S. in Sports Medicine.</p>
        <p>Post-college, I worked as an Athletic Trainer in several different settings, including professional baseball with the Boston Red Sox organization.  I currently work in business development for a MedTech company and reside on Camano Island with my wife Susan, daughter Isabel, son William, and dog Finn.<p>
